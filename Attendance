I chose Implementation
I chose it because I believe I am more comfortable explaining it than the other topics
I prepared by reading the slide deck for Implementation and reviewed by only reading the general topic slide (With all topics listed)

E00551236 10/3/2022:I chose requirements because I thought that was what I knew the least about out of the 3 topics.                 
I prepared by looking back at the required and optional reading as well doing some research on the topic for another perspective, then I typed out all of the main points I wanted to get across based off of what I thouhgt was imprtant.

Requirements
Experience with them in internship
Reviewed slides, wrote brief notes to refer to during presentation

E00707581: I chose design because It is my favorite stage, I enjoy designing. I prepared for presenting this by going back to the class readings, and familiarizing myself with the important key concepts. I then designed bulleted notecards to help as I talk through the concepts of design.

E00490237: 10/3/2022   I chose to cover Implementation, the reason being is that I felt like I had a better understanding of the material compared to the other two topics.
I prepared by reading the material and taking notes of the high points id like to cover and then organized them into a brief presentation.
             
E00579761: Requirements. Have some prior knowledge of topic. Reviewed required and optional readings.
                         
E00576418: Requirements
           It is the topic I felt I needed to review more, and it is very important in determining if a project succeeds or fails.
           I reread the required and optional readings to understand the topic more. I constructed my speech based on what I have been taught and added a couple of examples.

E00686223:
The topic I have chosen is requirements. I chose this topic because I did not do as well on the quiz as I'd have liked and want to make sure I understand the questions I missed. I prepared for this presentation by practicing my talk in front of my computer camera.
                         
E00586376: Implementation. I needed more work on it after our in class exercise. Looking more into it would help that. 
I looked through the slide deck and wrote notes down. once i had some notes down i structured a speech from those notes. I said the speech out loud twice.

E00501244: Design
I chose Design because it seemed interesting to learn how the steps of design are taken, getting into smaller parts of the requirements as more people work with each step.
I read the slides with the presenter's notes along with the website for design patterns, taking notes on what would be good to use in the speech.

-I chose Requirements. 
-I thought this section was the most interesting to me and found it fascinating how much preparation there is in building requirements for a solution.
