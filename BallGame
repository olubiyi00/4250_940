Payne Meade:
    Ball Must Bounce in random Direction
    The ball should not get stuck, or be able to get unstuck
    The speed of the ball is unchanging
    The drawing should not be able to keep the ball from bouncing
    The ball should take up a small part of the screen
    The ball should be able to bounce on the walls of the screen, as well as drawings

=======
Liam Whitelaw:
    The user must be able to draw pixels on the screen using the mouse
    The ball must be red, circular, 10 pixels in size along both dimensions, antialiased.
    The user pen must be black, 3 pixels diameter, and active when user drags the mouse while clicking
    The ball must float above all other windows
    The ball must bounce off the screen
    The program must be able to account for differing resolutions, DPI, and/or multihead (dual-screen) configuration
    The program must provide termination via a seperate windowed configuration interface
    The ball must detect pixels created only by the user pen.
    The ball must perform collision detection against strokes and determine how to bounce.
    The ball must have a fixed but user-configurable movement speed
    The ball must simulate physics in discrete timesteps of 60 ticks per second.
    The ball must not appear to clip through objects, subject to the above constraint.
    The program must use less than 5% of active CPU time on processors meeting minimum requirements TBD.
